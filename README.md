## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Extracted large-scale **telemetry data** from multiple sensors (camera, lidar, radar)  
   - Preprocessed data using **Python** to handle missing values, normalize sensor outputs, and align multi-modal signals  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Root-Cause Identification**  
   - Correlated **perception logs, telemetry signals, and ML model outputs**  
   - Identified **sensor confidence drops, object detection failures, and environment-driven edge cases**  
   - Used Python for statistical analysis, visualization, and pattern discovery  

3. **Dashboard Development & Visualization**  
   - Built **Power BI and Looker dashboards** for:  
     - Disengagement frequency monitoring  
     - Anomaly patterns  
     - Sensor health metrics  
     - Operational KPIs for engineering, QA, and program management  

4. **Machine Learning & Pattern Analysis**  
   - Applied **clustering and anomaly detection techniques** to identify recurring perception failure modes  
   - Highlighted **high-risk scenarios** for further investigation  

5. **Generative AI / LLM Automation**  
   - Leveraged **LLMs** to:  
     - Summarize investigation findings  
     - Cluster similar perception failures  
     - Automate insight generation, reducing manual effort  

6. **Pipeline & Process Automation**  
   - Built **SQL-based analytics workflows** for historical trend analysis and perception-specific root-cause analysis  
   - Implemented **JIRA-linked workflows** and **Confluence RCA templates** for structured investigation tracking
